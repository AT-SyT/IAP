Klukas\r\n\r\n**Software design and main development: C. Klukas (head of group)**\r\n\r\n**Pipeline development: J.-M. Pape**\r\n\r\n**Post-processing: D. Chen**\r\n\r\n### Welcome!\r\nThe Integrated Analysis Platform (IAP) has been designed and developed to support the analysis of large-scale image data sets of different camera systems. It aims in bridging different data domains and in integrating different approaches to data analysis and post-processing. \r\n\r\nIf you have any question, feel free to the designer and developer of IAP by [E-Mail](mailto:christian.klukas@gmail.com).\r\n\r\n### Download \r\n\r\nThe latest executable release is available from the release section: [Download Latest Release](https://github.com/OpenImageAnalysisGroup/IAP/releases)\r\n\r\n### Reference Information\r\nKlukas, C., Chen, D., Pape, J.M.: **Integrated analysis platform: An open-source information system for high-throughput plant phenotyping.** Plant physiology 165(2), 506-518 (2014) ([link](http://www.plantphysiology.org/content/165/2/506.abstract)).\r\n\r\n### Post-Processing High-Throughput Phenotyping Data\r\nOur approach for post-processing phenotyping data has been published in [The Plant Cell](http://www.plantcell.org/content/26/12/4636).
